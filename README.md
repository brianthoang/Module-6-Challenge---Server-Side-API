# Module-6-Challenge---Server-Side-API

For this week's challenge, we were given the user story of a traveler who wants to see the potential weather at multiple cities so that he can plan his trip accordingly. With this webpage, the user can search up a city and is then presented with the current and future conidition for that city. The city is then later added to the webpage's search history. When the user searches up a city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast. The current date is presented on a larger container that includes temperature, windspeed, humidity, uv index, and an icon that represents the weather condition. The other 4 days are presented in smaller containers with just temperature and humidity. If the user wants to look at his previous search history, then they can simply press on the container with the city and the forecasts are presented to them.
